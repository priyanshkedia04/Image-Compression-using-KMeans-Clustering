# Image-Compression-using-KMeans-Clustering

Clustering a type of Unsupervised Learning. K-Means Clustering Algorithm was used for the Compression of images by decreasing the colors present in the image. The model was built in Python using Sci-kit Learn Library and a User-Friendly interface was also developed in Jupyter Notebook using ipywidgets and interact.
